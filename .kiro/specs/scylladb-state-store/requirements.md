# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a ScyllaDB-based state storage backend for IPFS-Cluster to enable trillion-scale pin set management in a distributed, fault-tolerant manner. Current IPFS-Cluster uses consensus-based storage (etcd/Consul/CRDT) which has limitations for massive deployments. By integrating ScyllaDB as a state storage backend, we can achieve linear scalability, high availability, and predictable low-latency operations for managing pin metadata in globally distributed IPFS clusters.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cluster administrator, I want to configure IPFS-Cluster to use ScyllaDB as the state storage backend, so that I can manage trillion-scale pin sets with high performance and availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cluster administrator configures ScyllaDB connection parameters THEN system SHALL validate connection settings and establish connection to ScyllaDB cluster
2. WHEN ScyllaDB backend is enabled THEN system SHALL initialize required keyspace and tables if they don't exist
3. IF ScyllaDB cluster is unavailable at startup THEN system SHALL retry connection attempts with exponential backoff and log appropriate error messages
4. WHEN configuration is updated THEN system SHALL support hot reload of ScyllaDB connection parameters without cluster restart

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an IPFS-Cluster node, I want to store and retrieve pin state information from ScyllaDB, so that pin metadata is distributed and replicated across the database cluster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pin operation is requested THEN system SHALL store pin metadata (CID, replication factor, timestamp, placements) in ScyllaDB
2. WHEN pin state is retrieved THEN system SHALL query ScyllaDB and return current pin information with consistent read semantics
3. WHEN pin status is updated THEN system SHALL use conditional updates to prevent race conditions
4. WHEN pins are removed THEN system SHALL delete all associated metadata from ScyllaDB with proper cleanup

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the ScyllaDB state storage to handle node failures gracefully, so that pin state remains available even when some cluster nodes are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ScyllaDB nodes become unavailable THEN system SHALL continue operating with remaining available nodes
2. WHEN write operations fail due to insufficient replicas THEN system SHALL retry with appropriate backoff and eventually return error if consistency cannot be achieved
3. WHEN read operations encounter node failures THEN system SHALL automatically failover to available replicas
4. WHEN network partitions occur THEN system SHALL maintain eventual consistency and handle partition recovery correctly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ScyllaDB state storage to implement the existing state.Store interface, so that it can be used as a drop-in replacement for current state backends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ScyllaDB backend is implemented THEN it SHALL fully implement the state.Store interface without breaking changes
2. WHEN state operations are called THEN they SHALL maintain the same semantics as existing implementations
3. WHEN migrating from existing backends THEN system SHALL provide migration utilities for transferring state data
4. WHEN tests are executed THEN ScyllaDB backend SHALL pass all existing state storage test suites

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a cluster operator, I want comprehensive monitoring and observability for the ScyllaDB state storage, so that I can track performance and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ScyllaDB operations are performed THEN system SHALL generate metrics for operation latency, success/failure rates, and connection pool status
2. WHEN errors occur THEN system SHALL log detailed error information including ScyllaDB-specific error codes and retry attempts
3. WHEN monitoring systems query metrics THEN they SHALL receive real-time statistics about ScyllaDB performance and health
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN operators SHALL have access to query-level tracing and performance profiling data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the ScyllaDB integration to support multi-datacenter deployments, so that pin state can be replicated across geographical regions for disaster recovery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multi-DC setup is configured THEN system SHALL support ScyllaDB datacenter-aware replication strategies
2. WHEN writes occur THEN system SHALL respect configured consistency levels for cross-datacenter replication
3. WHEN datacenter failures occur THEN system SHALL continue operating from remaining datacenters
4. WHEN network latency varies between DCs THEN system SHALL optimize read operations using local datacenter preferences

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want the ScyllaDB state storage to be optimized for high-throughput pin operations, so that the system can efficiently handle massive concurrent workloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN concurrent pin operations occur THEN system SHALL use connection pools and prepared statements for optimal performance
2. WHEN batch operations are available THEN system SHALL group multiple pin operations into efficient batch writes
3. WHEN query patterns are predictable THEN system SHALL implement appropriate caching strategies for frequently accessed data
4. WHEN under high load THEN system SHALL implement backpressure mechanisms to prevent resource exhaustion

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the ScyllaDB integration to support secure connections and authentication, so that pin state data is protected in transit and at rest.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to ScyllaDB THEN system SHALL support TLS encryption for all communications
2. WHEN authentication occurs THEN system SHALL support username/password and certificate-based authentication methods
3. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN system SHALL support ScyllaDB encryption-at-rest capabilities
4. WHEN security is configured THEN system SHALL validate security settings and refuse to start with insecure configurations in production mode

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want enterprise-level authentication and authorization for the pinning API, so that I can control access to pinning operations based on roles and policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user submits API request THEN system SHALL authenticate user via JWT tokens, API keys, or DID signatures
2. WHEN authentication occurs THEN system SHALL integrate with external Identity Providers (Keycloak, Auth0, Web3 wallets)
3. WHEN authenticated user performs operation THEN system SHALL verify authorization through RBAC/ABAC policies
4. WHEN access attempts occur THEN system SHALL log all authentication and authorization events for audit
5. WHEN user lacks permissions THEN system SHALL return appropriate HTTP error codes and detailed messages

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want a billing system to track pin storage usage by users, so that I can monetize the pinning service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pin is created or updated THEN system SHALL record storage usage metrics by owner_id
2. WHEN data aggregation occurs THEN system SHALL daily summarize storage usage by users
3. WHEN cost is calculated THEN system SHALL apply configurable pricing tiers and generate billing events
4. WHEN invoices are generated THEN system SHALL integrate with external payment systems (Stripe, Filecoin, L2)
5. WHEN billing events occur THEN system SHALL maintain detailed history for audit and reporting

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring and alerting system for enterprise deployment, so that I can ensure high availability and system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system operates THEN it SHALL export Prometheus metrics for all components (API, workers, ScyllaDB, NATS)
2. WHEN operations occur THEN system SHALL track SLO metrics (p95 pin latency ≤ 60s, state drift ≤ 0.5%)
3. WHEN SLOs are violated THEN system SHALL generate alerts with detailed information for troubleshooting
4. WHEN diagnostics are needed THEN system SHALL provide Grafana dashboards with key performance metrics
5. WHEN critical events occur THEN system SHALL support integration with notification systems (PagerDuty, Slack)

### Requirement 12

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want scalable architecture with component separation, so that the system can horizontally scale and handle enterprise workloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN load increases THEN system SHALL support horizontal scaling of worker agents without downtime
2. WHEN message processing occurs THEN system SHALL use NATS JetStream for reliable message delivery between components
3. WHEN fault tolerance is required THEN each component SHALL be stateless and support multi-instance deployment
4. WHEN component failure occurs THEN system SHALL automatically route traffic to healthy instances
5. WHEN system is deployed THEN it SHALL support configuration via environment variables and config maps
